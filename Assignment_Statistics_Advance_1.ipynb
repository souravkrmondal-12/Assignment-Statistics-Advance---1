It essentially assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome of a random phenomenon. For example, the number of heads when flipping a coin three times, or the height of a randomly selected person, can be represented as random variables.\n",

        "Types of Random Variables:\n",

Each possible outcome (HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT) has a numerical value assigned to it, representing the number of heads in that outcome. This numerical value is the value of the random variable for that specific outcome.\n"

        "\n",
        "In a probability distribution, the expected value, also known as the mean or average, is a weighted average of all possible values of a random variable. It's the theoretical average you'd expect to get if you repeated the experiment or process generating the random variable many times. The weights in this average are the probabilities of each value occurring.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Random Variable: A random variable is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. For example, the number of heads when flipping a coin multiple times, or the height of a randomly selected student.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Probability Distribution: A probability distribution describes the probabilities of all possible values of a random variable. It essentially tells you how likely each value is to occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Expected Value: The expected value (E(x)) is calculated by:\n",
        "\n",
        "\t• Multiplying each possible value of the random variable (x) by its probability (P(x)).\n",
        "\n",
        "\t• Summing up these products.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, it can be written as: E(x) =  Σ (x * P(x))   \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Long-Term Average: The expected value represents the average outcome you would expect to see if you repeated the experiment many times. It's a measure of central tendency, meaning it's a value around which the results of the experiment tend to cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Imagine you have a coin that has a probability of 0.6 of landing heads and 0.4 of landing tails. Let X be the number of heads you get when you flip the coin once.\n",
        "\n",
        "• The possible values for X are 0 (tails) and 1 (heads).\n",
        "\n",
        "• The probability of getting 0 heads (tails) is P(X = 0) = 0.4.\n",
        "\n",
        "• The probability of getting 1 head is P(X = 1) = 0.6.\n",
        "\n",
        "The expected value of X (E(X)) would be: E(X) = (0 * 0.4) + (1 * 0.6) = 0 + 0.6 = 0.6\n",
        "\n",
        "This means, on average, you'd expect to get 0.6 heads when you flip the coin once.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Takeaways:\n",
        "\n",
        "• The expected value is a theoretical average, not necessarily a value that will actually occur in a single experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "• It's a useful concept for understanding the potential outcomes of a random variable and for making decisions in situations involving uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "• It's also used in various statistical methods and applications.\n"

        "\n",
        "------\n",
        "\n",
        "A probability distribution describes how probabilities are allocated to the possible values of a random variable. The expected value of a random variable is calculated by weighting each possible outcome by its probability, as defined by the probability distribution, and then summing these weighted outcomes. In essence, the probability distribution provides the framework for calculating the expected value, which represents the long-term average outcome of the random variable.\n",
        "  \n",
        "Elaboration:\n",
        "\n",
        "• Probability Distribution: A probability distribution is a mathematical function that assigns a probability to each possible outcome of a random variable. This function can be a probability mass function (PMF) for discrete random variables or a probability density function (PDF) for continuous random variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "• Expected Value: The expected value (also known as the mean or average) of a random variable is the weighted average of all possible outcomes, where the weights are the probabilities associated with those outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "• Relationship: The expected value is a direct consequence of the probability distribution. To calculate the expected value, you multiply each possible outcome by its probability (as given by the distribution) and then sum these products. This weighted sum gives you the expected value, which represents the average outcome you would expect if you repeated the experiment many times.\n",
        "\n",
        "• Example: Consider a coin toss. The possible outcomes are heads (H) and tails (T). If it's a fair coin, the probability distribution would assign 0.5 to both H and T. The expected value of this random variable (number of heads in one toss) is 0.5 * 1 (for heads) + 0.5 * 0 (for tails) = 0.5. This means that on average, you would expect to get half a head in one toss, which is not a real outcome, but rather a representation of the long-term average.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the probability distribution provides the probabilities for each outcome, and the expected value is a calculation based on those probabilities, representing the long-term average outcome of the random variable."
